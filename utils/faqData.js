    question: "1.What is Diabetes Mellitus?",
    answer:
      "Diabetes mellitus is a group of metabolic diseases in which the person has high blood glucose (blood sugar) level either due to inadequate insulin production or because the body’s cell does not respond properly to insulin or both.It describes a metabolic disorder of multiple etiology characterized by chronic hyperglycemia with disturbances of carbohydrate, fat (dyslipidemia) and protein metabolism resulting from defects in insulin secretion, insulin action, or both. Your pancreas- an organ, located between your stomach & spine, that helps with digestion-releases a hormone it makes, called insulin, into your blood. Insulin helps your blood carry glucose to all your body cells. Sometimes your body doesn’t make enough insulin or the insulin doesn’t work the way it should. Glucose then stays in your blood & doesn’t reach your cells. Your blood glucose levels get too high & can cause diabetes or pre-diabetes. Over time, having too much glucose in your blood can cause health problem.",
